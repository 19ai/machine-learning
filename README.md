# machine-learning

#### Repository Description

Documenting machine learning and data mining techniques. Each folder’s work is independent of one another.

#### Documentation Listings

**Coursera : 2015.10.16** ( fix document later)

Course project for the Practical Machine Learning on Coursera. Using R’s tree and rpart library for classification.

**ROC : 2015.10.16** ( kept for personal reference, view the logistic_regression folder instead )

Use of ROC curve and cost to determine the threshold for logistic regression on the titanic dataset.

**clustering : 2015.11.6**

Some useful evaluations when working with hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering ( k-means++ is used here ).

- Calinski-Harabasz index : Determine the right k ( cluster number ) for clustering.
- Boostrap evaluation of the clustering result’s stability.
- View report [here](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/clustering/clustering.html).

**lda_1 : ** in progress 

Performing text clustering with Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA).

- Toy sample code of the gibbs sampling version.
- View document [here](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/lda_1/lda_1.html)

**linear regression : 2015.10.30**

Solving linear regression with gradient descent. 

- View report [here](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/linear%20regression/linear_regession_1.html).

**logistic_regression : 2015.11.25** 

Focus on choosing the optimal cutoff value for logistic regression ( classification algorithm ) when your dataset is unbalanced. e.g. The majority of the observations in the dataset have a positive outcome, while few have negative, or vice versa.

- Visualize two by two standard confusion matrix and ROC curve.
- View documentation [here](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/logistic_regression/logistic_regression.html).

**text_similarity : 2015.11.19** 

Illustrates k-shingle, Minhash and locality sensitive hashing for solving the problem of finding textually similar documents. 

- View detail [here](http://ethen8181.github.io/machine-learning/text_similarity/text_similarity.html).

**tf_idf : 2015.11.17** 

Introducing tf-idf ( term frequency-inverse document frequency ), a text mining technique and using it to perform text clustering using hierarchical clustering.
