During the process, far-from-optimal candidates gets dropped and are never seen again, while close-to-optimal candidates are combined with each other and maybe mutate slightly to see if they can get closer to optimal.

    "\n",
    "Just like in evolution, you might be inclined to have the best and strongest chromosomes of the population mate with each other (The technical term for mating is **crossover**), with the hope that their offspring will be even healthier than either parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each generation we'll retain a portion of the best performing chromosomes as judged by our cost/fitness function (the portion is a parameter that you can tune). These high-performers will be the parents of the next **generation**, or more intuitely, the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mating these parents is also very simple. You randomly pick two chromosomes, a male and a female (just a metaphor), and pick a point in the middle. This point can be dead-center if you want, or randomized if you prefer. Take that middle point (called a \"pivot\" point), and make two new chromosomes by combining the first half of one with the second half of the other and vice versa (It's usually recommended to use even numbers as your population size).\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeating the mating step, we repopulate the population to its desired size for the next **generation**. e.g. if you take the top 30 chromosomes in a population of 100, then you'd need to create 100 new chromosomes by mating them."

    "**Crossover** is the main step of how you get from one generation of chromosomes to the next, but it alone has a problem: If all you do is mate your candidates to go from generation to generation, you'll have a chance of getting stuck near a \"local optimum, an answer that's pretty good but not necessarily the \"global optimum\" (the best you can hope for).\n",
    "\n",
    "A GA would achieve very little if not for the combined effects of both **crossover** and **mutation**. **Crossover** helps discover more optimal solutions from already-good solutions, but it's the **mutation** that pushes the search for solutions in new directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutation** is a completely random process by which you target an unsuspecting chromosome and blast it with just enough radiation to make one of its elements randomly change. How and when you mutate is up to you. e.g. If you choose a **mutation rate** of 0.1 (again any rate you want). Then if you randomly generated a number from 0 to 1 and if it happens to be below 0.1, the chromosome will **mutate**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the **mutation**, it can be randomly picking a element of the chromosome and add the number by 5, dividing the number by 2 or change it to a randomly generated number. Do whatever you want with it as long as it's relevant to the context of the problem. Like in the beginning of our problem, we set a maximum and minimum boundary when generating our initial values for each of the chromosome `min = 0 max = 100`. Then for our **mutation**, we can restrict our mutated number to be within this boundary (not really necessary here, but more problems that have indispensible boundaries this is crucial). And if we cross that border we can simply set it back to the value of that border (e.g. the mutated number is 102, we can simply squeeze it back to 100, our upper bound)."

    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic building blocks (parameters) of GA consists of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chromosomes**. Representations of candidate solutions to your problem. They consist of the representation itself (in our case, a N element list)\n",
    "- **Population**. A group of chromosomes. The population will remain the same size (you get to choose your population size.), but will typically evolve to better cost/fitness scores over time.\n",
    "- **Cost/Fitness Function**. Used to evaluate your answer.\n",
    "- The ability to **Crossover** and **Mutate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population experiences **generations**. A typical GA takes the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a population. Just fill it with completely random chromosomes that does not step over the boundary, if there is one.\n",
    "2. Calculate the cost/fitness score for each chromosomes.\n",
    "3. Sort the chromosomes by the user-defined cost/fitness score.\n",
    "4. Retain a certain number of the parent chromosomes, where you get to pick the number of chromosome that will retain.\n",
    "5. Mate the retained parent chromosomes to generate the children chromosomes. You can decide how you want to mate them. This process will keep going until the number of children chromosome is the same as the number of the original parent chromosome. \n",
    "6. Mutate the children chromosomes at random. Again, you can decide how to do this (resticted to the boundary).\n",
    "7. Compare the parent chromosomes and the children chromosomes and choose the best ones (e.g. you have 100 parent chromosomes and generated 100 children chromosomes, you compare 200 chromosomes and retain the best 100 chromosomes). In other words, we're killing the poorly performed children.\n",
    "8. If the algorithm has not met some kind of completion criteria, return to step 2 with the new chromosomes. The completion criteria for this example is pretty simple: stop when you get a cost of 0. But this isn't always the case. Sometimes you don't know the minimum achievable cost. Or, if you're using fitness instead of cost, you may not know the maximum possible fitness. In those cases you can stop the algorithm if the best score hasn't changed in 100 generations (iterations), or any other number depending on how much time are you willing to wait or the computation resources that you have, and use that as your answer.\n",
